# Javascript in C
This is supposed to be a .h file that adds in JavaScript commands into your C files, which you would for sure use if you are more used to JavaScript more than C

How to use:

in Your .c file's directory, put the JavaScript.h file in the same directory, in the .c file, use the #include file, and put "JavaScript.h"... you probably already knew how to use .h files
